1. What is Version Control Application VCA?
	-Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of 
	files over time so that you can recall specific versions. Version control 
	is used to manage multiple versions of computer files and programs. 
	A version control system, or VCS, provides two primary data management capabilities. 
	It allows users to 1) lock files so they can only be edited by one person at a time, 
	and 2) track changes to files.

2.  What are the example of Version Control Application?

3. What are the two types of VCA, and give example each?
	-Version control systems are broken down into two main categories,
	 centralized and decentralized (also known as distributed).
  		Example of Centralized
		-Subversion which is considered a centralized version control system
		Example of Distributed
		-Git and Mercurial

4. What is Git?
   Who inveted or developed Git?
	 -Git is the new fast-rising star of version control systems. Initially developed by
 	 Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds, Git has recently taken the Web development community by storm.
 	 Git offers a much different type of version control in that it’s a distributed version control system.
	 With a distributed version control system, there isn’t one centralized code base to pull the code from.
	 Different branches hold different parts of the code. Other version control systems, such as SVN and CVS, 
	use centralized version control, meaning that only one master copy of the software is used.

5. What is Github?
	-GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a Web interface to the Git code repository and management tools 
	for collaboration.
